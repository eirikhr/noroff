Tasklist:

Replace all inputs except hidden inputs with getinput()
    Rewrite function so it takes an argument:
        getinput("Enter your name") prints what its asking for and returns the input?
Create function for hidden input (getpass) and implement it.

Implement two-player game
Research curses, possibly a snake game?
